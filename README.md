# Orbital-Space-Environment-Ontology

The name 'OSEO' or 'Orbital Space Environment Domain Ontology' is conceived as an alternative and possibly more accurate name for an ontology of the domain of interest in question. It better captures the whole picture of objects, occurrences, processes, relationships in orbit (orbital space) and those activities and infrastructure by which we attain situational awareness of those objects, occurrences processes and relations in and of orbital space. This name may therefore replace that of the space situational awareness ontology, in whichcase SSAO would take on the more narrow scope described above (those entities yielding situational awareness of the orbital and near-earth space envrionment). This task is pending and TBD.
