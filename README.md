# The Orbital Space Environment Domain Reference Ontology / Orbital Space Domain Ontology / Orbital Space Ontology 

An ontology of the orbital space domain, encompassing orbital debris and other orbital objects and phenomena. As such it includes classes from ODO (https://github.com/rrovetto/The-Orbital-Debris-Ontology/).

The name 'OSEO' or 'Orbital Space Environment Domain Ontology' is conceived as an alternative and possibly more accurate name for an ontology of the domain of interest in question. It better captures the whole picture of objects, occurrences, processes, relationships in orbit (orbital space) and those activities and infrastructure by which we attain situational awareness of those objects, occurrences processes and relations in and of orbital space. This name may therefore replace that of the space situational awareness ontology, in whichcase SSAO would take on the more narrow scope described above (those entities yielding situational awareness of the orbital and near-earth space envrionment). 

In other words, This ontology name better reflects and generalizes the overal orbital universe of discourse (subject-matter / domain of interest) of the Orbital Debris domain and the Orbital Debris Ontology  as expressed in [1][2]. 

## Status
This name change from SSAO to OSEO (or OSO) is TBD, pending further development and research of the overall space ontology project and domain demarcation.
